the `ADD` instruction 's immdiate num  is 5 bits so it's range is [-16,15]. it can't be #30

**solution**

        ADD  R3,R3,#15
        ADD  R3,R3,#15
yes, it says
>can't be represented as a signed number in 5 bits

Count the num of zeros and store it in R3 ,the num of  non-zero (namely positive here)  integer  in R4

`STR R0,R2,#1`  is wrong
because R2 's content is the vector , not the address x3500 of the vector.


solusion:

insert a instruction before it
`LD R2, VECTOR `
## 7
count the amount of negtive number  stored in [x4000,x4009]
## 8
Interrupt-driven I/O id more efficient .
Because  polling checks the status register every clk , it's less efficient and slower . As for interrupt-driven io ,only  when there is service needed for io , the cpu stops its current task and deal with io .After that ,  it continuese its task.

1. set KBSR with x4000 to indicate that there is no keyboard input  interruption. 
then keep outputing the ascii character 2 , which ascii code is #50
2. output the character twice and return         to the main routinuee
3. It has no changes 
 //to do

output `ABCDEFGHI`
